<section id="aboutintro"><p>
  If you know me personally, you know that I love to travel + spend <b class="blacktext">way</b> too much of my free time planning + bargain hunting + flight searching + reading reviews. It's like a hobby? No seriously - <i class="tealtext">my favorite 'social media' = scanning Southwest Airlines for steals on long weekend trips.</i> When it came to deciding what my personal blog would mainly focus on, there was truly no other option. Not only do I have experience, but it will also force me to take more trips.<i id="emoji">*hands in the air like sarcastic OH WELL, emoji*</i> I like to put a focus on making the most of weekend trips, day trips + long layovers, though I will share the goods on long trips + the "if you have time"'s as well. Ah, Travel. 
</ br>
</br>I have included an area dedicated to my homebase of Nashville because, uh, it's the greatest + everyone should include it on their list of "to-travels". Truly. Sincerely. Visit Nashville if you have the chance.
</ br>
</ br>I have also included a random section that explains exactly how I learned to code in HTML, CSS and Javascript in one month. Random? Not so much. The only reason I have this blog is because I wanted to create something with code that was ALL ME, created by me, avoident of layouts, and exactly what I wanted. <i class="tealtext">Can you say control freak? Guilty. </i>
</ br>
</ br>
Last - <i class="tealtext">THANK YOU.</i> It can be intimidating to put any kind of original 'work' out for the world's viewing, and the internet can be a scary place. So, thank you for taking the time to look over my code creations. Thank you in advance for reading my blogs + sharing your thoughts in a respectful way. I am not of the <i class="tealtext">easily offended</i> type, but I do take shit to heart + enjoy feedback. So, thank you for contributing contructively + thank you for even clicking the link to find yourself here. Let's have some fun.</p>
