          <p>Let's get right to it. I hate technology, I can house a temper, and have broken more phones and remote controls by throwing them than I'd care to admit. I'm not embarrassed by it <i>per se</i>, but rather shocked that I now willingly spend my days on computers learning about. . . computers - AND enjoy it? Who am I? How did this happen? Just, what? All valid questions and the only answer is that I really don't have a direct answer. It was a slow burn until it became an all-consuming obsession o the right you'll see my reaction when Siri misinterprets my request for <i class="tealtext">tacos near me</i>. But seriously, enjoy the process. Everyone is different and the joy of this skill is that you can easily make it your own. It's the perfect balance between technicality and creativity. All in all, I hope something you find here encourages you to keep learning, keep trying, keep pushing yourself. One of the most exciting things to me about coding and programming is that there are endless ways to learn and it will always keep evolving.

        <ol>  <section id="gettingstarted"> <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          
            <p><li> It started with <strong class="tealtext">curiosity</strong>. I bought a book <i class="tealtext">(HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett)</i>, partly because it was beautiful, partly because it had excellent reviews. Then came the <em class="tealtext">interest</em>.</p>
            </li><p>
              
             <li> I am assuming that since you have found yourself on this page, you are considering, or already have, taken it a step further. If you are just a friend or family member browsing through my blog - holaaaa. <b class="tealtext">If you find that you are interested in learning more, I would encourage you to learn the basics and fundamentals of HTML & CSS first.</b> They are a front-end developer's bread and butter. Learning how the two interact has helped tremendously.
            </li>  </p>
   <p>
      <li> Apply, apply, apply. Use text editors to apply while you learn. There are so many resources to edit your text and some that let you see your edits real-time. One of my favorites is <a href="https://codepen.io/" id="codepenlink">CodePen</a>.
            </li> </p>
            <p><li> Enjoy it. If you are competitive, even with yourself, it is important to understand that being good at something takes time and practice. If you are trying to go from complete novice to expert, understand that you are putting unrealistic pressure on yourself. This is the pep-talk I continue to give myself. Enjoy the process, expecially if you are self-guiding your knowledge. </li>
